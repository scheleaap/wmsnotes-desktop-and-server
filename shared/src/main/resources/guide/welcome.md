# Welcome to WMS Notes!

## Changing a Note's Title

A note's title is automatically set based on the note's first non-empty line.

Your note should usually start with a header, followed by its contents:
```
# My First Note

This is my *first* note! ðŸŽ†
```
The note's title will then become "My First Note". Similarly, if you do not use a header, the entire first non-empty line will be used:
```
Shopping List

* Bread
* Milk
```
The note's title will then become "Shopping List".

## Formatting

Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to format your notes.
